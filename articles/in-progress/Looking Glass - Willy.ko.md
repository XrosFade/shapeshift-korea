# Through the Looking Glass Clearly: Willy Ogorzaly

ShapeShift Visionaries Reflect on the DAO After Six Months

### 3부작 시리즈 중 1부작

ShapeShift는 중앙 집중식 엔티티에서 DAO(분권형 자율 조직)로 완전히 전환한 최초의 설립 기업입니다. 6개월 이상 지난 후, 우리는 DAO 구조를 통해 조직, 플랫폼의 사용자 환경 및 이를 구축하는 커뮤니티를 개선할 수 있는 방법에 대한 그들의 기대와 현실이 일치하는지 알아보기 위해 이러한 움직임을 촉발한 세 명의 비전가들과 이야기를 나누었습니다.

이 시리즈는 중앙 집중식 ShapeShift의 주요 제품 매니저이자 현재 FOX Foundation의 지방분권 책임자인 Willy Ogorzaly(윌리 폭스)로 시작합니다(DAO로의 원활하고 성공적인 전환을 보장하는 역할도 일부 담당함).

**Q: Few individuals were more excited for ShapeShift to transition into a DAO than you, who are famously known for your phrase, “This is the best day ever." Tell us why you were so excited.**

A: I first fell in love with DAOs at ETHDenver 2020. That weekend a couple friends and I built Coz, the DAO to save the world, and won first place in the hackathon. Over the following year, I experienced the magic of DAOs first hand as Coz united with Giveth, cultivated a community, and launched a beautiful product, https://giveth.io. So when Erik Voorhees announced that ShapeShift was transforming to a DAO, I literally jumped out of my chair with excitement. I am a huge believer in ShapeShift’s vision to bring financial sovereignty to the masses, and I think we are in the best position to achieve this as a DAO. 

**Q: What was it like in the early days of forming the DAO?**

A: The fast pace of concepts and projects evolving from ideation, to proposal, to launch is stunning. Many of the things we have achieved would have died in legal review or would have been diminished to the point of losing their original value in a more corporate model.  Since there are no employees, we gain contributions from developers, writers, and engineers from all over the world. 

The DAO has the agility to keep up with the fast-paced world of crypto; proposals go straight to the community governance vs. to a manager or legal review team. 

The hive mind allows the pace of innovation to flourish. In a traditional corporation, shareholders in stock have limited influence to enact changes and suggestions; in a DAO, all FOX Token holders can make their voices heard.

There is never a dull moment in DAO land, and multiple projects are in flight at any given time. In the early days, this rapid pace often felt overwhelming, and at times it still is. Fortunately, the community is constantly working to improve processes and structures. It’s amazing to see how much we’ve evolved in such a short span of time.

**Q: Can A DAO be regulated?**

A: It’s not clear yet how regulators can begin to regulate DAOs. While traditional entities are incorporated within legal jurisdictions and managed by appointed officers, DAOs exist as smart contracts on borderless networks, managed collectively by token holders around the world, many of whom are pseudonymous. It’s not even clear which jurisdiction’s regulations apply to DAOs. Furthermore, when a regulator wants to get in touch with a DAO, where do they even send the letter? It’s inevitable that regulators will try to regulate DAOs, but whether they can is yet to be determined. One of the most interesting aspects of DAOs is that regardless of whether or not they can be regulated, they can’t be stopped. As long as Ethereum keeps running, FOX Token holders can create and enact proposals on the DAO’s treasury, and there is nothing any regulator can do to stop it. 

What is on the horizon for the ShapeShift DAO?

The new version of ShapeShift launched on January 20. App.shapeshift.com is open-source, free to use, and generates affiliate revenues for the DAO. Most importantly, the app is designed to be fully decentralized and unstoppable. ShapeShift DAO is currently developing FOXChain, a decentralized network to reward node operators for providing accurate blockchain data to end users. The launch of FOXChain is essential not only for ShapeShift, but for any app that truly wants to be decentralized. FOXChain is eyeing proof of concept in three months, with a full launch by the end of 2022.

Taken together, this means that ShapeShift v2 is open-source, free to all, community-owned, and will soon be completely decentralized.
